# Summative Task

## Overall goal

My summative task will be a simulator designed to test how sturdy a house will be

I will allow the user to input the strength of the beams in the house and how fast the wind accelerates and then it will simulate how long it will take for the house to fall down if at all.

If I have time I will give the user the ability to simulate an earthquake and they will imput the magnitude and it will simulate how long it will take for the house to fall down.

## Sub-goals

* extend Motion class (that we developed earlier together) to allow for force accumulation (wind, gravity, other forces)
* Allow user inputs
* modify the visual representation of the Motion class to more closely resemble a house
